# Introduction to Intune

Mobile device management (MDM) and Windows PC management are the cornerstone of  the modern IT department. Today workers, staff and students are more mobile and engaged than ever. Your success depends upon delivering information where it's needed while ensuring that information is protected. You need to deploy apps, protect devices, ensure updates are in place, and provision email faster than ever while defending company information.

## Mobile device management
Intune can manage iOS, Android, Mac OS X, and Windows Phone devices, as well as Windows RT and Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 devices as mobile devices. If you're looking at [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] for a mobile device management (MDM) solution, review [Intune's MDM capabilities and features](mobile-device-management-capabilities-in-microsoft-intune.md).

## PC management
You can install the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] client software on Windows PCs to enable management. Once a PC is managed you can deploy apps and software updates, manage Endpoint Protection and Windows Firewalls, provide remote assistance, and much more. See [a full list of PC management capabilities](windows-pc-management-capabilities-in-microsoft-intune.md).

## App management
You can also use Intune to [deploy and manage apps](/Intune/deployuse/deploy-and-configure-apps-with-microsoft-intune.html). App management helps you protect data from being shared outside of your business by restricting actions such as copy, cut, paste, and save-as between Intune-managed apps and personal apps.

This data protection is built directly into many Microsoft mobile apps but you can [extend data protection to your existing line-of-business apps](/Intune/configure-and-deploy-mobile-application-management-policies-in-the-microsoft-intune-console.html) with the Intune App Wrapping Tool. You can also establish secure content viewing with the [Intune Managed Browser](/Internet/manage-internet-access-using-managed-browser-policies-with-microsoft-intune.html). To further protect corporate information, you can [selectively wipe managed apps and related data](Intune/deployuse/retire-data-and-devices-from-microsoft-intune-management.html) on devices that are unenrolled, no longer compliant, or lost, stolen, or retired from use.
