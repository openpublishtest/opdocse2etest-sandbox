# What to know before you start Microsoft Intune
Before you set up Intune, familiarize yourself with the capabilities covered in this topic, and in those listed below:

- General capabilities of Intune
- [Intune supported web browsers](..\supported-web-browsers.md)
- [Network infrastructure requirements for Microsoft Intune](..\network-infrastructure-requirements-for-microsoft-intune.md)
- [Administrative accounts, websites, and permissions in Microsoft Intune](..\administrative-accounts-websites-perms.md)
- [Microsoft Intune Company Portal](..\microsoft-intune-company-portal.md)
- [Intune integration with Microsoft cloud services and products](..\integration-with-cloud-services.md)

- [Domain names for Microsoft Intune](..\domain-names-for-intune.md)
- [Choose how to manage devices with Microsoft Intune](introduction-to-microsoft-intune.md)

After you are familiar with the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)], you should be ready to set up your subscription. If you start with a trial subscription, at a later time you can convert it to a full subscription. To convert a trial subscription, see [How to buy Microsoft Intune](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/microsoft-intune/Purchasing.aspx).

## General capabilities of Intune

-   **Manage mobile devices and computers, no servers or intranet required.** You can manage mobile devices and computers, even if those devices are not joined to a domain or brought on-site. This makes [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] ideal for a company with a mobile or geographically-distributed workforce.

-   **Require encryption of mobile devices and computers.** Mobile devices that support encryption can be required to use it. You can also require computers that support Bitlocker drive encryption to use it. If a mobile device or computer with encryption is lost or stolen, the data on the device’s storage media is unreadable, helping to secure that data it from theft.

-   **Generate hardware and software inventories and reports.** You can gather information on the hardware and software used by your company, helping you to plan your hardware upgrade cycle or determine if unwanted software is installed on managed devices.

-   **Monitor mobile devices and computers.** You can create alerts to notify you when there is a problem with a mobile device or a computer, and also have alerts trigger e-mail notifications so that the right people are informed of the problem.

-   **Provide a “self-service” model for IT.** Users can use the Company Portal to enroll devices, to install site-licensed software, or to find contact information for IT administrators.

-   **Support multi-factor authentication.** [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] supports multi-factor authentication. For details, see [Protect Windows devices with multi-factor authentication](/Intune/DeployUse/protect-windows-devices-with-multi-factor-authentication.md).

-   **Available in multiple languages.** Intune is now available in the following languages: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish. For a list of the countries where the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../includes/wit_nextref_md.md)] service is supported, see [International availability](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/international-availability).
