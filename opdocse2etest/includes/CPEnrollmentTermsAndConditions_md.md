**Set Terms and Conditions**
You can publish terms and conditions that your users will see when they first use the company portal from any device, whether or not that device is already enrolled. Users will have to accept those terms to access the portal. When you update the terms and conditions significantly and want users to see and accept them, you can mark the new terms and conditions as a new version, and users will go through the same process the next time they visit the portal.

In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](http://manage.microsoft.com) click **Company Portal** &gt; **Terms and Conditions**.

Specify the following:

-   **Require users to accept company terms and conditions before using the Company Portal**

-   **Title**

-   **Text for terms**

-   **Text to explain what it means if the user accepts**

You can see [details about  terms and condition ](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt405893.aspx).  You can also see which users have accepted the terms and conditions by using the [Terms and conditions reports](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn646977.aspx).
